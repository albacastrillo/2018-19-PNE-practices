Here you will take your notes

Client-server model
    c: client
    s: sever

The client starts a communication and the sever generates a respond message with the info that the client is asking for.
The sever can help many clients.
The server is a program that answer to the request but if there are no clients it will wait till a client arrives.
We always need the server because otherwise there will be errors.
(*)computer:any device capable of executing code
In the computer of the client there can be many programs and inside the server's computer too.
We can have one computer running two programs: the client and the server.
They are connected trough a network called internet.
Inside the internet there are many isolated computers connected to each other inside different networks.
All the computers connected have at least one network interface: IP Address
When we connect to a different 'wifi' we have a new IP Address

My phone IP address at URJC: 10.0.41.249
ifconfig --> IP address of the computer: 212.128.253.88

to see if the computer is alive: ping 8.8.8.8 --> each line is a different ping with the time it takes to answer.

* ping time to 8.8.8.8: time=3.61 ms
* ping time to my computer: time=0.066 ms
* ping time to Veronica's computer: time=0.504 ms
* ping time to my phone: time=35.0 ms

It is not possible to have less ping time than this computer

To identify the network interface for humans: ping www.google.com (URL) and then it will give you google's IP: 216.58.211.228
* ping time to www.google.com: time=3.68 ms
* ping to URJC: 192.168.46.45  time=2.31 ms

Port is a number that refers to the different applications inside a machine; so we need two numbers to connect to the serve: the IP and the port
